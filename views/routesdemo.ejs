      Here we give demos showing how to communicate between server and client in Express.

<h2>Simple demo</h2>
Our first demo is <a href="/simpleform">/simpleform</a> 
which generates a form asking for username and age.

When the user fills out the form and hits submit, the data is put into the response header and sent to the server.

The server gets the data from req.body and puts the username and age into the res.locals object. 

The res.render('/simpleresponse')  takes that data and puts it into an HTML page sent back to the user.
